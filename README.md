# matlab
Welcome to my Matlab repository. This is where I will store matlab scripts that I write. There will likely not be many, because Matlab is not a predominant language in the field of quantum chemistry.

The reaction kinetics script was edited from a template provided during Chem59B at Brandeis University.
